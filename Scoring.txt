Clearing Lines:

The player is awarded points for clearing a line. multiple points are given for clearing multiple lines at once.
Higher levels may result in more points each line.
Gentle Drops:

If the player manually moves the piece down more quickly without using a hard drop, points may be given.
Hard Drops:

Hard drops, in which the player causes the piece to fall to the bottom right away, could earn points.
Getting to the Next Level:

Leveling up could occur after obtaining a particular amount of points.
Leveling up:
Leveling Standards:

Leveling up could occur when the player reaches a particular point total or number of lines cleared.
Acceleration in Speed:

The game may get faster as the player advances to higher levels, which would make it more difficult.
End of the game:
Declining Situations:

If a new piece cannot be placed on the board (for example, if components are blocking the spawn site), the game may end.
If the pieces build up to the top of the board, the player can also lose.
Gaining the Advantage:

There isn't a conventional "winning" condition in classic Tetris. The goal is to reach a high score before you lose.
Hypothetical Example:
Rating:

100 points for clearing one line.
300 points for clearing two lines.
Three lines cleared: 500 points
800 points for clearing 4 lines in Tetris.
Leveling up:

Every 1000 points, get a level.
End of the game:

if the stack tops out or a piece is unable to be placed on the board.
