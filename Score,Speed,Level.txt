Scoring:

Score is increased when lines are cleared. The formula for scoring is: score += 50 << cleared;, where cleared is the number of lines cleared at once.
The more lines you clear simultaneously, the higher the score.
Speed:

The game has a variable called gameSpeed, representing the speed at which the Tetris pieces fall. Initially set to 1.0.
The speed can be adjusted as the player progresses through levels, providing a dynamic and potentially more challenging experience.
Level:

The game has a variable called level representing the player's current level.
The initial level is set to 1.
The level may be increased based on certain conditions, such as the number of lines cleared or elapsed time.
The level can affect the game speed (gameSpeed), making the game progressively faster as the player advances.
